# wiggles

The wiggles program was created as a helper for kids that are doing sensory exercises daily to guide and time the routine.


## Setup
1) This program requires Pythonista IOS application. Install from the link below

http://omz-software.com/pythonista/

2) Launch pythonista and hit the + sign

3) Select Empty Script

4) Select create (Must not be located on iCloud for shortcuts)

5) Name it wiggles

6) Paste the code into the wiggles script window

### Shortcut

I have created a shortcut via IOS shortcut. The pythonista add to home screen had bugs relaunching the app so I recommend using the built in shortcuts app

Link to shortcuts app:
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752

1) Create new shortcut

2) Search for Python and select Run Script

3) After run type wiggles with no arguments

4) Select the "share" up arrow and click "Add to home screen"
